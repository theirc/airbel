#Part 1: Manifesto
The Airbel Playbook is here to answer key questions about **who** we are, **what** we do, **how** we do it, and **why**. For those new to Airbel, it introduces our philosophy, culture, approach, and structure. For long-time staff and colleagues, it can serve as a refresher or a reference.

This is a one-stop shop for our most important policy documents. If you are looking for specific information about how we make decisions, run projects, and structure staffing, you can find it all here. If something is missing, or you aren't sure where to find what you need, please let us know at [airbel@rescue.org](mailto:airbel@rescue.org).

The Airbel Playbook was created mainly for Airbel staff, IRC colleagues, and, in some cases, donors and partners.

##What does Airbel do? What is our goal?
###IRC mission
The International Rescue Committee was founded in 1936 to help people affected by conflict and disaster to survive, recover and gain control of their future.

###Airbel mission
The mission of the Airbel Center is to *design*, *test*, and *scale* life-changing solutions (products, services and delivery systems) for people in crisis

##How do we envision our work changing the world?
The [Airbel Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d7xDSNa0Upd4POtqe0jbm8YoGVsSvbzi8BE2QaSve44/edit?usp=sharing) is to design, test, and scale life-changing solutions. 
 
**Design:** User-centered, iterative, and interdisciplinary
**Test:** Rigorously and tailored to the solution
**Scale:** Large scale in the most fragile, conflict-affected places, piggybacking on existing infrastructure and institutions
**Life-changing:** The rights and opportunities to work, learn, access health services and feel safe 
**Products and services:** Best-in-class approaches, using the right technology for near and future impact
**Systems:** Finance that is fast and flexible; services that are distributed to maximize reach, speed and equity

##What is the Airbel culture? What do we value?

**One step beyond the comfort zone.** We are bold and perseverent.

**Results-Driven.** We center clients in our discussions and decision-making.

**Optimistic.** We believe a better world is within our grasp.

**Curious.** We foster a sense of childlike wonder and pursue answers to difficult questions.

**Generous.** We acknowledge our own limitations and seek the support and knowledge of others.

**Open.** We share what we learn and build.

Our [Draft Values Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PWWglC37-lbuCS0BQARFECUotCHCDt8gtY7XSILIPQk/edit?usp=sharing) describes our values in detail. 

#Section 2: Deciding what to work on
##How do we come up with ideas?
Airbel sources its ideas in different ways, largely through:

1. Identifying big problem areas or opportunities for innovation through **evidence review** and **design research**

2. Identifying big hunches or hypotheses from **experts, advisors, and trends scanning**

3. Identifying big challenges faced by **country programs and users**

While a lot of ideas come from within the Airbel team, and the broader team at IRC Headquarters in New York, we are working with our field colleagues to increasingly work on ideas that come from the field. For example, our Middle East regional hub is sourcing ideas from the region. [Mahali lab](https://medium.com/airbel/mahali/home) plays a key role in this effort.

##How can I propose a project?
An Alpha version of the submissions platform for ideas to the [**Innovation Fund**](https://theirc.github.io/airbel/innovation-fund.html) has been set up here. You can submit a form for any ideas you have for problems to address or solutions to create [here](https://theirc.github.io/airbel/innovation-fund.html).

##How does Airbel evaluate project ideas and decide where to invest?
Airbel has a portfolio governance approach which focuses on transparency and accountability, diversified risk, vision & scale, flexibility with clear outcomes, and strategic prioritizagtion.

The main components of our governance approach are: 

1. The Quarterly Review Process

2. Stage Gages

3. Advisory Network

These three components are outlined in full in the [Airbel Portfolio Governance Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

You can read the [full governance document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#Section 3: Our projects
##What tools do we have for designing, testing, and scaling solutions?
Based on best practice and Airbel experience, we have compiled a set of tools which can be used to facilitate solutions as they move through the pipeline.

###Design
We develop ideas by drawing on three sources of information: 1) understanding the context and user journeys; 2) understanding the evidence base; 3) finding inspiration from solutions to analogous problems. We aim to make ideas concrete as quickly as possible by prototyping.

* **[Research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jxuNb-JvZzSWOccpVDrTH99jXuv5nMS9NkB5CB9EmX8/edit?usp=sharing)**  

* **[Generate solutions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p5ZISUKXV3nVlzOKouq5lggZDaDBVXfCYwiFTNwh-MQ/edit?usp=sharing)**

* **[Prototype](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mfognFa3vW1fVgWUTyZSGC5xd5x5aRSQ8zzk1kI5AeM/edit?usp=sharing)**

###Test
After learning about the desirability and feasibility of an idea, we pilot and test our solutions. During the initial pilot, we continue to tweak and refine the solution, before more piloting more rigorously, often at greater scale.

* **Pilot (forthcoming)**

* **Rigorous Evaluation (forthcoming)**

###Scale
We consider whether the idea is cost-efficient & simple enough to scale from the outset, as well as pathways to scale.

* **Scale (forthcoming)**

##How do we check in on projects to make course corrections?
Each month, an [operational check-in](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnzrU9iaOFl6uEqy82MQsOW-B989k-vmvYv1KE9xZTY/edit?usp=sharing) is held to get a good picture of pipeline health. 

##How do we decide whether to continue projects?
Strategic reviews are held of the full portfolio and department on a quarterly basis, which provides the opportunity for regular decision-making on how to pursue or move forward on different opportunities. Formal decision-making around next steps for projects takes place during stage gate meetings which are scheduled based upon the project's progress. More details are available in the [governance document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

###Stage Gate FAQ
####Who attends Stage Gate meetings?
Stage gate meetings include the senior management team and project leads as active participants. Later stages also include colleagues from technical units and/or external experts. All Airbel team members are also welcome to join as observers. A [readout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFh7P1l0Uwr6NWmxSGhXBPyK8rWJEZB0PJKL6zty95s/edit?usp=sharing) will also be shared following each stage gate meeting.

####What do Stage Gates entail? What are the criteria for passing through them?
Criteria differ depending upon which Stage Gate you’re going through. The [Stage Gate Governance Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing) outlines the 
but you should always refer back to our [Airbel project criteria](https://medium.com/@airbel/how-airbel-selects-projects-b9a7d2cdecd7). Generally, we look at potential for impact, scale, and cost-efficiency, as well as fit in portfolio. At later stages, scalability becomes more and more important. Generally projects are mapped against our Airbel project criteria. 
 
####When will Stage Gates be held?
Stage Gates take place based on project needs, and are initiated by project leads. A calendar of upcoming stage gates is available in the Airbel Department Tracker.

As soon as there is substantial work being put into a project we should put it through Stage Gate 0. This is an initial endorsement to determine whether an idea, hypothesis, or solution should enter our portfolio. Ideally, you should go through Stage Gate 0 before any in-depth identification work takes place.

One a project is in the portfolio, Stage Gate 1 should happen before the design process begins (still pretty early on in the process). The project should go through stage gate 1 before beginning the design process. Stage gate 2 should come before piloting or evaluation. And finally, Stage Gate 3 should take place before we start thinking about scale.
 
####Why do we have Stage Gates?
The Stage Gate structure helps us to dig in and analyze our projects on a more strategic level, thinking through their potential for moving forward as well as evaluating our portfolio as a whole. Importantly, these are moments for project leads to make the case for next steps, as well as to acquire additional resources, through the Innovation Fund and otherwise.

####How do I put my project through a Stage Gate?
Consult [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit) and fill in the relevant form for [Stage Gate 0](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFTOISRfh9T9K-B8fNEqm3wSo6XEd_RTNCj7G9LTYBnszLDw/viewform), [Stage Gate 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTatNQ3XbaglomB4QRWxPsk9C0H6CZ04piMq2AGQVmLcaQRw/viewform?usp=sf_link), [Stage Gate 2](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5NljhvzZ73U5ijKpK7-Shj25ZRwlQpxDV8fZuTl7IEVAUig/viewform?usp=sf_link), or [Stage Gate 3](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco6_5HOFcBbHHfgBzjuh0noJIKfgyuS0BvJ3LKbicjjaUWdA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Then set up a meeting with the Airbel Senior Management Team to discuss. For Stage Gates 2 and 3, there will be a second meeting held with internal and/or external stakeholders.

##What measurements do we use to define success?
The Airbel Department measures success with a [set of Key Progress Indicators (KPI)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12vldapYqg0zU5vVI8fXzuohJJrLFgVQAGJfgadG7l1w/edit?usp=sharing), which cover the innovation process, operational excellence, and the impact of our work.

Specific indicators exist for the different projects in our portfolio.

##How does Airbel bring in outside expertise?
The Airbel Advisory Network provides intellectual and strategic guidance to Airbel with the objective of improving the quality, rigor and imagination of the Airbel portfolio. The Network serves to ensure that all of our projects are set up to successfully scale beyond their current scopes through private sector exits, government policy or other avenues.

The Network will be composed of researchers, innovators, private sector leaders, practitioners and policy-makers and will serve as an intellectually engaging space to shape the innovations launched, implemented and scaled at Airbel.

You can find more details on the Advisory Network in the [Airbel Portfolio Governance Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

##How do we scale projects?
Guidance on scale is forthcoming

#Section 4: The Department
##How do we evaluate our work and ensure we're generating impact?
On a regular basis, projects are evaluated through the [quarterly review process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing). Through the quarterly review process, the Senior Management Team takes the opportunity to reflect on accomplishments and challenges from the past quarter, provide an overview of the portfolio and deparmtne, and update on finances and fundraising. You can view an [example from Q1 of FY19 here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/153CF4_Vs8bA6E3_ppcKfUIQ1mgn-WhEXuw3f1r9Y-rw/edit?usp=sharing).

##How are we structured?
You can learn more about this in the [Airbel structure document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rB6g8pesuEVyoeTMX6xFz-KlgJ2RT6gBb5D8NgbNwkw/edit?usp=sharing), which outlines the org chart, roles and responsibilities of the Senior Management Team, 

##What is the Airbel Board?
The Airbel Board provides key support and oversight. Additional details on the makeup of the board and its functions are forthcoming.

##How does Airbel ensure diversity and inclusion?
Airbel has assembled a working group on diversity and inclusion and has begun discussing the way forward for this area of work. Additional details are forthcoming.

##How does Airbel manage human resources?
Airbel human resources are managed in accordance with [IRC policies and structures](https://rescuenet.rescue.org/interact/Pages/Section/Default.aspx?Section=3112). Additional guidance is forthcoming.
