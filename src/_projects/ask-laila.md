      Although Ask Laila was considered highly promising, it faced some
      challenges around scale-ability and cost. For the time being, IRC elected
      to pursue other possibilities, including [Caseworker
      Communication](/projects/caseworker-communications/).

      Postcards were distributed to Arabic speakers, including versions targeted
      at both men and women, announcing a new service to help answer questions
      refugees have. The service was used by about 100 people in 24 hours. The
      majority of callers were women.

Recently resettled refugees have many questions. They may struggle to get answers to their questions quickly and easily. In particular, vulnerable groups, such as women and people with mental illness, may have sensitive questions which they might not be comfortable asking in a traditional casework setting. Ask Laila was conceived to address this challenge - providing clients with a hotline to connect with a trusted local source in their own language. Alongside the hotline, the prototype included text messages and a Facebook group where refugees can connect with one another.
