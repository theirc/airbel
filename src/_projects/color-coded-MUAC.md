Local community health workers are key to treating more children in hard-to-reach places, but the tools to help them diagnose and treat malnutrition are complicated, and not all community health workers can read or count. The Airbel Center redesigned a number of critical tools for low-literate community health workers to more effectively treat children suffering from or at risk of malnutrition.

We removed numbers and highlighted colors on a longitudinal middle upper arm circumference (MUAC) tape to easily monitor weekly progress and identify whether a child’s health is deteriorating or stationary. We built a treatment register with a unique identifier for each child, so that community health workers can match the correct patient card to the correct register page without needing to read the child’s name. We also created a numberless dosage scale, ensuring that community health workers and caretakers give their children the right amount of food.
