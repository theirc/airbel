      Prototyping sprint takes place in Tanzania to test three mobile-based
      concepts. One focused on caregivers, one on youth, and one - which later
      became Coach Erevu - on teachers. The sprint aimed to understand current
      technology use, feasibility and desirability of different mobile channels
      of delivery, and validating the concept of teaching SEL through different
      parties.

      Coach Erevu begins with the goal to: “design a flexible and durable
      learning and teaching experience that dramatically improves a child’s
      acquisition of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and literacy in their
      primary school years”

#### The lack of cost-effective teacher training and continuous professional development for teachers in crisis-affected contexts results in poor quality teaching.

While access to formal schooling has [increased](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2017) over the past 25 years across low-income countries (LICs), the majority of children complete primary education without basic literacy and numeracy skills. 250 million school-aged children cannot read or write after 4 years of schooling.

One of the major drivers of low educational attainment is poor quality teaching. Interventions that [improve](https://doi.org/10.7916/D898854G) teacher instructional techniques can improve student’s academic achievement. Evidence also shows that ongoing teacher support, such as mentoring or coaching, is [more effective](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1121254109) than a one-off training.

#### There is a narrow focus on purely academic learning outcomes, when there is growing evidence to suggest that social-emotional competencies are critical to later academic achievement, health and wellbeing.

Social-emotional learning (SEL) can help children develop the skills needed to regulate their emotional responses, positively interact with others and better persevere in adverse situations.
