Available funding is not enough to meet the world’s vast needs for aid. When crises strike or intensify, humanitarian actors must lose precious time mobilizing funding. This means humanitarian response is often not just too little, but too late.

Displacement insurance would help countries and NGOs access the funds needed to provide life-saving assistance quickly and effectively. Just like other types of insurance, it would provide the holders with payouts when a need arises. Displacement insurance could be held by national governments, NGOs, or donors. Payment would be triggered by events such as a large increase in refugees, or the onset of conflict. Payouts would be made either directly to the aid providers, or through the route of the donor. Either way, funds would travel much more quickly to ensure people in need can access quality services - including food, healthcare, and shelter.

Currently, Airbel is working with the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development to better understand the market for such a product. This research could lead to a groundbreaking, innovative and lifesaving redesign of humanitarian crisis response funding.
