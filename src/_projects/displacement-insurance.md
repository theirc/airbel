Available funding is not enough to meet the world’s vast needs for aid. When crises strike or intensify, humanitarian actors often spend their time mobilizing funding rather than directly responding to those in need. This means humanitarian response is often not just too little, but too late.

Displacement insurance would help countries and NGOs access the funds needed to provide life-saving assistance quickly and effectively. Just like other types of insurance, it would provide the holders with payouts when a need arises, based on a pre-determined trigger like a large increase in refugees, or the onset of conflict. These products would insure against a severe humanitarian crisis. Donors would pay the premium on insurance and payouts would be made directly to the aid providers. This would ensure that funds would travel more efficiently and effectively to first responders, so that people in need can access quality services such as food, healthcare, and shelter.

Displacement insurance has the ability to transform the sector by re-structuring the financial incentives that shape the way humanitarian response happens.

Airbel is working with United Kingdom’s Department for International Development’s Centre for Global Disaster Protection to assess the potential to use risk-based financing approaches to respond to refugee influxes. This work has identified five fundamental challenges in humanitarian financing, and developed a number of potential risk-based financing solutions to address those challenges, including catastrophe bonds, insurance instruments, and others.

Over the past year, the Airbel Center and DfID’s Centre for Disaster Protection have conducted a landscaping and series of Innovation Labs to assess the potential to use risk-based financing approaches to respond to refugee influxes. Through this process, we identified five fundamental challenges in humanitarian financing and developed a number of potential risk-based financing solutions to address those challenges, including catastrophe bonds, insurance instruments and others.
