A virtual coaching program for refugee teachers on how to promote students’ social and emotional wellbeing. Social-emotional learning, or “SEL”, can help children develop the skills needed to regulate their emotional responses, positively interact with others and better persevere in adverse situations. Coach Erevu aims to build the SEL skills of teachers through weekly video clubs, timely habit triggers, and bite-sized localized teaching materials. Our solution can be implemented as separate components or one holistic approach. 

#### How does it work?

* Training and coaching sessions occur during 1-hour weekly video clubs.
* Refugee teachers implement what they learned in their classroom during daily designated ‘SEL time.’
* Teachers are rewarded and supported with localized SEL cards that signal they are trained SEL teachers and can be used as teaching aids in the classroom.
