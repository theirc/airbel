  Over 16 million children under the age of 3 are afflicted by severe acute
  malnutrition. To pinpoint the most impactful prevention methods, Sprout is
  experimenting with 3 distinct approaches.

      3 villages were selected for participation in the Tillaberi region of
      Niger

      One of those villages has an existing community warehouse used for storing
      food aid from the government and NGOs.


      Two community mobilizers per village worked to get to know their community
      members and build trust with community leaders and caregivers. The
      mobilizers observed which practices caregivers use for promoting healthy
      child growth and with the help of IRC nutrition specialists, identified 19
      positive practices for Sprout to promote.

      Developed a prototype to understand how post-harvest loss reduction, small
      cash transfers, and promotion of locally-relevant positive practices meets
      user preferences and can support adoption of SAM risk-reduction actions.

      * Spent time with caregivers in remote villages in western Tanzania to
      understand:
        * How they are affected by post-harvest loss?
        * What advice do they have for raising healthy children?
        * What actions would they like to be able to take and what would they need to do it?
      * Consulted providers in SAM-affected areas to understand the local
      drivers of SAM

      * Met with regional and national nutrition experts in Senegal to
      understand current best practices, constraints, and which new directions
      for SAM prevention they are most excited by

      * Spent time with families along the Liberia-Guinea border to understand
      their priorities, interests, and current investments in caring for their
      children

      * Conducted observations in clinics to observe interactions between
      providers and caregivers to understand current practices and opportunities
      for prevention

      * Conducted expert interviews and desk reviews to understand the potential
      for impact on SAM treatment and cost at scale of innovations in SAM
      prevention being spearheaded by members of the No Wasted Lives Coalition

      * Developed a model to analyze interactions between innovations under
      various scenarios with input from nutrition experts (users can manipulate
      the model to change assumptions as they like)

Current malnutrition prevention efforts range from breastfeeding exclusively to multi-pronged approaches that include a dizzying number of interventions like home gardens, cash transfers, and feeding practices all together. But none have proven to be effective and scalable prevention methods.

To pinpoint the most impactful methods, Sprout is experimenting with 3 distinct approaches:

1. **Positive Practices:** Identifying and promoting existing practices in communities, like hand washing and diversifying the foods children eat, that are associated with SAM prevention, and then introducing choices for additional, relevant practices that women can decide to adopt. Supporting women in changing their ability, motivation, and opportunity to adopt or intensify positive practices.
2. **Post-Harvest Loss:** Offering an alternative service to current storage practices that better protects against losses of crops from rodents, insects, and fungus; and may offset the cost of operations.
3. **Cash:** Providing modest quantities of unconditional cash to pregnant women and caregivers of children under 3 years to prompt the uptake of new behaviors, like eating (rather than selling) eggs or buying soap.
