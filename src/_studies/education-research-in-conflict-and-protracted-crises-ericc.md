### **News**

ERICC is thrilled to announce that University College London (UCL) has joined the ERICC consortium as academic partner, and that Professor Tejendra Pherali, Professor of Education, Conflict and Peace IOE - Education, Practice & Society at UCL, will co-lead the ERICC consortium as co-Research Director, alongside Silvia Diazgranados Ferrans, Director of Education Research at the IRC.

### **About ERICC**

**Education Research in Conflict and Protracted Crisis (ERICC)** is a three-year Education in Emergencies (EiE) research programme funded by the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Countries in focus include Bangladesh (Cox’s Bazar), Jordan, Lebanon, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria, and the programme is comprised of four main components:

1) Research on the most effective approaches to education in conflict and protracted crisis,

2) In-Country Operational Support

3) Promoting research uptake across FCDO and the international community, and

4) Knowledge Systems Strengthening

### **The ERICC consortium and approach to research**

Leading ERICC components 1 & 2, and coordinating closely with leads for components 3 & 4, is the **ERICC Research Programme Consortium (RPC)**, a global research and learning partnership that strives to transform education policy and practice in conflict and protracted crisis around the world — ultimately to help improve holistic outcomes for children — through building a global hub for rigorous, context-relevant and actionable evidence base.&nbsp;

ERICC RPC seeks to identify the most effective approaches for improving access, quality, and continuity of education to support sustainable and coherent education systems and holistic learning and development of children in conflict and crisis. ERICC aims to bridge research, practice, and policy with accessible and actionable knowledge, at local, national, regional and global levels, through co-construction of research and collaborative partnerships.

The ERICC RPC is led by the [International Rescue Committee (IRC)](https://airbel.rescue.org/studies/education-research-in-conflict-and-protracted-crises-ericc/), in collaboration with [IOE](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/ioe-faculty-education-and-society), UCL’s Faculty of Education and Society, and expert partners include [The Centre for Lebanese Studies](https://lebanesestudies.com/), [Common Heritage Foundation](https://commonheritagefoundation.org/), [Forcier Consulting](https://www.forcierconsulting.com/), [ODI](https://odi.org/en/), [Osman Consulting](https://www.osmanconsulting.co.uk/), [Oxford Policy Management](https://www.opml.co.uk/our-locations/nigeria) and [Queen Rania Foundation](https://www.qrf.org/en). During ERICC’s inception period, [NYU-TIES](https://globaltiesforchildren.nyu.edu/ericc) provided research leadership, developed the original [ERICC Conceptual Framework](https://inee.org/resources/conceptual-framework-education-research-conflict-and-protracted-crisis-ericc) and contributed to early research agenda development.

**ERICC RPC is committed to four primary principles for conducting rigorous research:**

* Having developed and using [ERICC Conceptual Framework](https://airbel.rescue.org/studies/a-conceptual-framework-for-education-research-in-conflict-and-protracted-crisis-ericc/) to conduct systematic evidence reviews, evidence building and evidence based decision-making
* Developing contextual understandings of the Political Economy of Education of different conflict and crises settings
* A co-constructive approach to building research agendas through stakeholder engagement from the start for evidence use and evidence uptake
* Applying a research methods framework to build evidence in a systematic and rigorous way

### **ERICC publications**

At the end of ERICC’s inception year the RPC published the&nbsp;[ERICC Inception Report](https://rescue.app.box.com/s/wfok2frnel8mbwf5cmiaulyjec3wrrvj) in March 2023. The report provides an overview of the consortium, the ERICC theory of change, the ERICC Conceptual Framework, process for developing country research agendas and much more.&nbsp;

Read the [ERICC Conceptual Framework](https://airbel.rescue.org/studies/a-conceptual-framework-for-education-research-in-conflict-and-protracted-crisis-ericc/) developed by NYU Global TIES for Children during the Inception Period, and interact with the [ERICC Conceptual Framework - interactive version](https://view.genial.ly/635c02d38a3dbf0019b0111d/interactive-content-ericc-icf-or-published).

In response to the crisis in Ukraine, ERICC developed a policy brief, [Preventing a Lost Generation in Ukraine: Recommendations for Supporting Education in Emergency Humanitarian Response](https://inee.org/resources/preventing-lost-generation-ukraine-recommendations-supporting-education-emergency).

Upon conducting systematic evidence reviews on the state of education in settings of conflict and protracted crisis, the RPC has found there is little to no evidence of ‘what works’ and even fewer studies with analysis at policy-systems level. Through the stakeholder consultation and co-creation process — at local, national and global levels — RPC is identifying key gaps and prioritizing critical issues with end-user stakeholders for improving access, quality and continuity of education in conflict and protracted crisis settings — and for improving coherence within education systems — ultimately for improving holistic outcomes for children.
